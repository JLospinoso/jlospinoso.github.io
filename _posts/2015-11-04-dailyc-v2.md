[dailyc][2] v0.1.0 released [two months ago][1], giving users the ability to
send multimedia messages at regular intervals. In v0.2.0, we add the ability to
subscribe email addresses by adding them to `config.json`:

```json
{
	"imageDirectory": "../img",
	"subscribers": [
		"..."
	],
	"emailSubscribers": [
		"dailyc@lospi.net",
		"mom@lospi.net",
		"dad@lospi.net",
		"..."
	],
	"messages": [
		"..."
	]
}
```

There is some additional configuration necessary in `application.properties`
(still residing in `dailyc/dailyc-core/src/main/resources/`) to configure your
outbound email traffic. You'll need to add these to the existing properties
[required for v0.1.0][2]:

```properties
email.userName=josh@lospi.net
email.password=AAABBBCCCDDD
email.hostName=smtp.myemail.com
email.sslSmtpPort=587
email.attachmentName=dailyc.jpg
email.fromName=Dailyc Sender
email.toName=Dailyc Receiver
email.from=dailyc@lospi.net
```
Using the [Apache Commons Email][3] made it very straightforward to include email subscribers--all we needed was a little wiring between it, `gorm`, and `Spring Batch`. You can check out [the additions here][4].

I've also updated `README.md` with a minimal [getting started][2].
