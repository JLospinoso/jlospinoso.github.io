Shift5 co-founder Josh Lospinoso kicks of the inaugural Washington DC C++ User Group Meeting with a talk about object lifetimes, resource ownership, exceptions, and copy/move semantics in C++. Combined, these ideas allow the developer to employ the powerful resource acquisition is initialization (RAII)/constructor acquires destructor releases (CADRe) paradigms.

The source material for this talk is (Chapter 4 of C++ Crash Course)[https://ccc.codes]. The companion code can be found (on Github)[https://github.com/JLospinoso/ccc/tree/master/chapter_4]
